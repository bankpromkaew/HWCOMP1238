## Week 1 History
- Modern Writing System
  - Alphabet development
  - type writer and keyboard
- key Terminology
  - Typeface : design of letters
  - Font : Collection of Typeface
  - serif/sanserif(Font without decorative stroke)
  - Upper/Lower Case
## Week 2 Representing Text and Numbers in Computer
- Binary Systems
  - bit represent one of two states > 0 and 1
  - byte 1 byte consist with 8 bits
- Memmory Type
  -  Volatile Memory lose data when power loss (Eg. Ram)
  -  Non-Volatile Memory Retain data even power off (Eg. SSD,HDD)
- Number represents
  - Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
  - Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
  - Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.
- Text Representation
  - ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
  - Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline)
- File Types
  - Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
  - Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.
## Week 3 Structure of Text
- Text structure
  - Early text structures in printing and typewriting.
    Example: Ancient texts with commentary.
  - Modern Examples:
    Newspapers, ledgers, and digital formats like JSON.
- Key Concenpt
  - Lines and Indentation: Lines are fundamental in coding., Indentation helps in visual understanding.
  - Paragraphs: Important in HTML for text presentation.
Markdown:
- Mark up Language
  - Simple syntax for formatting.
  - Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
  - Italic: _italic_
  - Bold: **bold**
  - Lists: * item or - item
  - Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.
- HTML: More verbose than Markdown.
  -Tags: <\ul>, <\li>, <\p>, <\strong>, <\h1>, <\h2>, <\h3>
- Special Characters and Escaping
  - Special Characters: Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *. Escape sequences prevent special interpretation. 
  ``Example: \# to display # in Markdown.
  - HTML Escaping: Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.
- Structure data
  - Json {"key" : "value"}
  - XML similar with html use to represent as tag
- Unicode : Similar to ASCII but have much more alphabets and UTF-8 is the popular using to encoding the internet
## Week 4 Manipulating Text & Text Editors
- Keyboard Mastery
  - Importance: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.
  - Types: Standard 104-key layout.
  - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.
  - Layouts: QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.
  - Modifier Keys: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
  - Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.
- Text Editors
  - Types: Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).
  - Popular Editors: Vim: - Command-line based, requires learning commands. Exit command: :q!
                          - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Widely used, feature-rich.
  - Extensions and themes available.
    - IDEs: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.
- Search Techniques
  - Basic Search: Use Ctrl + F for finding text.
  - Advanced Search:
    - Wildcards: Use * for any character sequence.
    - Regex (Regular Expressions): For pattern matching.
      Example: line\d+ finds "line" followed by digits.
## Week 5 Command line Interface
- Introduction to Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
  - History and Evolution:
     - Originated from teletype machines connected to computers.
     - Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens.
     - Commands are often short due to historical reasons.
  - Modern CLI Usage
    - Advantages:
      - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.
      - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.
      - Easier automation through scripting.
      - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.
      - Minimal resource usage on computers.
  - Remote Access and Security
    - SSH (Secure Shell):
      - Connect to remote computers securely.
      - Allows command line access to remote systems.
    - File Transfer:
      - scp: Securely copy files between computers.
      - sftp: Secure file transfer protocol.
